                    Table Tennis is a fast paced racket sport that players
                    use a small padel to hit a lightweight ball over a net.
                    The goal of the game is to serve the ball between you and 
                    your opponent while trying to make the ball unreciporcal 
                    for your opponent in order to win a point.

                <p>
                    Tableable tennis (ping pong) games are played to 11 points, requiring a 2-point lead to win, 
                    with matches typically best 3-of-5 or 4-of-7 games. Players alternate serves every 2 points, 
                    with the ball must be tossed at least 6 inches, struck behind the table, and bounce on both sides.

                <h2 class = "section-title">History of the Sport:</h2>
                <p>
                    Table tennis originated in Victorian England during the 1880s as an indoor, 
                    upper-class parlour game inspired by lawn tennis, often using cigar box lids for paddles, 
                    corks for balls, and books for a net. Originally called "whiff-whaff" or "ping-pong," 
                    it gained traction with celluloid balls in 1900, the formation of the ITTF in 1926, and Olympic debut in 1988.
